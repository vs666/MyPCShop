            We at PC-Cart believe in decentralised technology. We intend to provide the product that the user wants, not forcing them to limit to a small set of choices.
            The idea is still at stage-0, and hence is only a website that scoops minimum prices of individual components of Comuters, and present them to you.
            However, we have great plans ahead, with our own pc-assembler centres, you have to just select the products and order. We will deliver customised and assembled PC.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
        We are also beliver of the fact that technology should be free and shared, so we intend to collect your custom PC details, that will help us recommend the best PCs\
        even to those of you who want to have a good PC at great cost, with no pre-specified needs.
            <br></br>

        Thankyou for visiting us, hope you have a great time...</p>);
