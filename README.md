## Web Application

![page-1](./unessential_data/P1.png)
The following is the PC-cart homepage

The following are some features that I think are worth mentioning : 
1. In-build search feature for items that are available on the website
2. Create-account, login feature that enables us to save user's current wishlist/cart contents for future sessions.
3. Web-scrapper that extracts prices from different websites for same product and displays them on the web page
4. Good design with seperate frontend, backend and database for easy migration of stack to MERN or other forms, and easy debugging and adding of features.
